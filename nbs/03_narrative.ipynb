    "* We sought to use two different system - RealEye and Tobii - to gleen data regarding student attention with respect to visual stimuli based on General Chemistry problems.\n",
    "* Each system produces a time series of coordinates that (should) indicate where the students were looking when solving a given problem. Any given coordinate will henceforth be called a **gaze point (gp)**.\n",
    "* Data resolution:\n",
    "    * Tobii, 120 Hz, more expensive\n",
    "    * RealEye, 30 Hz, less expensive\n",
    "* Many questions come from this\n",
    "    * Can the data sets be reconciled or aligned, such that for a given wall-clock second we can compare a RealEye gp with a Tobii gp\n",
    "    * Can RealEye be just as accurate as Tobii?\n",
    "    * Why does RealEye visualize a splotch?\n",
    "    * Can we reproduce RealEye's visualizations? Tobii's?"
