# RevChem


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Purpose

`RevChem` is the software library behind the data processing of data
exported from RealEye and Tobii systems. We are sharing our tools in the
spirit of transparency, scientific reproducibility, and friendship; to
augment your efforts working with the timeseries aspects of video data
that may inform and impower your work as an educator / curriculum
designer

## Whatâ€™s inside

- `RevChem/`: The portable source code library that would be used if you
  wanted to run your own analyses. This is what is installed when you
  install this project
- `nbs/`: the directory of notebooks that were this project. Some export
  code, others simply demonstrate the work we are trying to do.
